# Micromaterials Learning Objectives

One of the big challenges in creating micromaterials is knowing what to make them about. Since the goal would be to focus on specific and measurable learning objectives, it would be good to get a bit list of what those are.

> Fair warning, this is mostly just a place for me to write down the different things I'm thinking about all in one place.

For example, if we're creating micromaterials for security engineers, it would be good to have a list of all the things that security engineers have to do (eg, actively scan source code for sql injection vulnerabilities and then verify that an applied fix has remediated the issue).

Or for an SRE, one potential task would be to add instrumentation to a microservice so that it fulfils the requirements of o11y 2.0 (basically sends a bunch of arbitrarily wide events).

Or for an AWS cloud engineer, something like is able to add caching in front of a database in a 3-tiered web application and quantify the performance enhancements.

...All these are things that are tangentially related to actual tasks that different types of engineers need to do, so if we can get a list of a bunch of these things, it'll be a lot easier to create micromaterials to practice them.

What follows are the categories, and then just a bunch of unordered lists of things that could be decomposed to varying degrees to create learning objectives, which could in turn inform materials design.

## Network Engineers

## Security Engineers

## Site Reliability Engineers

## General Cloud Engineers (mostly system design)
